# Stremio Streaming-Server Protocol Map

Authoritative route surface that an unmodified Stremio client (TV apps, web player) calls on its
"streaming server". **Extracted directly from the reference bundle** `server.js` **v4.21.1**
(`docs/server-url.txt` → `https://dl.strem.io/server/v4.21.1/desktop/server.js`) via the route
registrations (`.get/.post/.use("/…")`). Line numbers are offsets in that minified bundle for
follow-up handler reading. **The first pass missed every route registered with `.all`** — twelve,
among them `/:infoHash/create` (issue #3), `/create`, `/proxy/:opts/:pathname` and each archive
family's `/create` — so check `.all` too when re-reading the bundle.

> Status legend per endpoint:
> - **route ✓** = registration confirmed in server.js (this pass).
> - **shape ⏳** = response body shape still to be captured as a live fixture (Stage 0 Task 0.3).

To reach **API parity**, each endpoint needs: method · path · params · response shape · status codes.
This document fixes **method + path** (done); **shape** is filled from captured fixtures.

## 1. Torrent playback (core — show-stoppers)

| Method | Path | server.js | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/:infoHash/:idx` and `/:infoHash/:idx/*` | 18420 | **Byte-range file stream** (direct play) | MUST honor HTTP Range (206, Content-Range, Accept-Ranges) + HEAD. Lazily creates the engine on first request. `idx` **-1** = choose the file (GuessFileIdx: the largest media file) — stremio-core writes it for a stream with no `fileIdx`. `tr=` values arrive in peer-search form (`tracker:<url>`, `dht:<ih>`). |
| ALL | `/:infoHash/create` | 18356 | **Start a torrent, choose its file** | stremio-video calls it before streaming whenever a stream carries `sources` or no `fileIdx`; a non-2xx answer is fatal to playback. Body: `torrent.infoHash`, `peerSearch.sources`, `guessFileIdx` (`{}` / `{season, episode}` = choose, `false` = the client has an index). Answer: the stats object once metadata is in, plus `guessedFileIdx` when asked. stremio-core also calls it, with no guess, for a magnet opened in the app. |
| GET | `/:infoHash/stats.json` | 18344 | per-torrent stats | downloaded/speed/peers/… (shape ⏳) |
| GET | `/:infoHash/:idx/stats.json` | 18346 | per-file stats | (shape ⏳) |
| GET | `/stats.json` | 18348 | global stats | `{}` when idle |
| GET | `/:infoHash/remove` | 18413 | drop a torrent engine | |
| GET | `/removeAll` | 18417 | drop all engines | |
| GET | `/favicon.ico` | 18342 | — | trivial |

> Note: torrent engines are created **lazily** by requesting `/:infoHash/:idx` — but the player
> calls `/:infoHash/create` first for any stream that carries `sources` or lacks a `fileIdx` (see
> the table). This map used to say torrents had no create call, and every such stream failed to
> start until 1.6.4. `POST /create/:createKey` (96033) + `/stream/:key/:fileName` (96043/96053)
> are a **separate** local-file/url streaming flow, not the torrent path.

## 2. Transcode / HLS (hlsv2 sub-router — hardest parity surface)

`.use("/hlsv2", …)` (46592). Sub-routes (75764+):

| Method | Path (under `/hlsv2`) | server.js | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/:id/:track.m3u8` | 75764 | media playlist (video0/audio0/subtitle0) |
| GET | `/:id/:track/init.mp4` | 75779 | fMP4 init segment |
| GET | `/:id/:track/segment:sequenceNumber.:ext` | 75795 | media segments (.m4s/.ts/.vtt) |
| GET | `/:id/destroy` | 75869 | tear down converter |
| GET | `/:id/burn` | 75812 | (subtitle burn-in) |
| GET | `/probe` | 46637 | ffprobe a `mediaURL` |
| GET | `/hwaccel-profiler` | 46818 | supported HW accel profiles |

Query params observed on hlsv2 requests (from live logs): `mediaURL`, `videoCodecs` (repeatable),
`audioCodecs` (repeatable), `maxAudioChannels`, `maxWidth`. **master.m3u8** is requested too
(legacy route family below also exists).

### Legacy/alt HLS family (top-level `/:first/:second/…`, 46625+)
`master.m3u8` (46626), `hls.m3u8` (46625), `stream.m3u8` (46627), `stream-q-:quality.m3u8` (46628),
`stream-:stream.m3u8` (46629), `stream-q-:quality/:seg.ts` (46630), `stream-:stream/:seg.ts` (46631),
`mp4stream-q-:quality.m3u8` (46632), `mp4stream-q-:quality/:seg.mp4` (46633), `dlna` (46634),
`subs-:lang.m3u8` (46635), `thumb.jpg` (46636). Also `/:infoHash/:videoId/:playlist/:HLSSegment?` (46604).

## 3. Settings / info / control (handshake)

| Method | Path | server.js | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settings` | 46772 | read server settings (transcode*, bt*, cache…) (shape ⏳) |
| POST | `/settings` | 46782 | write partial settings |
| GET | `/network-info` | 46741 | network/IP info (shape ⏳) |
| GET | `/device-info` | 46755 | device info (shape ⏳) |
| GET | `/get-https` | 46801 | HTTPS/cert provisioning flow |
| GET | `/status` | 75852 | status |
| GET | `/heartbeat` | 46790 | keepalive |
| use | `/casting/` | 46691 | casting sub-router (SSDP/DLNA) |
| ALL | `/proxy/:opts/:pathname` | 71022 | **proxy an addon's HTTP stream with the headers it needs** — served since 1.6.7 (GET/HEAD); see the note below |
| use | `/local-addon` | 46798 | local addon sub-router |

> `/proxy` (served since 1.6.7): `<opts>` is a query string read from the raw path — `d` the
> destination origin, `h` a request header `Name:value` (repeatable), `r` a response header
> (repeatable). stremio-video builds it for any stream whose addon sets
> `behaviorHints.proxyHeaders`; stremio-core builds it for external players. Redirects are
> followed as stock does (Location against the origin, `h` re-applied, the fifth is an error) and
> `.m3u`/`.m3u8` playlists are rewritten to come back through the proxy. Our additions, because
> this server may face the internet and serves the web player on the same origin: a client on the
> home network (`STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_ADDON_ALLOW`, by default the private ranges) may proxy
> anywhere but to link-local addresses and two cloud-metadata addresses outside them
> (`100.100.100.200`, `fd00:ec2::254`), any other client -- or a web page on another site -- only
> to public addresses. A page is this server's own, not another site, when it is the Stremio web
> app, or when its host, at any port, is the host the request went to, the host `SERVER_URL`
> names, or an address on the home network. Every answer carries `Content-Security-Policy:
> sandbox`, and `r` may not set cookies, that policy, Clear-Site-Data, Refresh or Location; a
> request carrying this server's own proxy marker is refused on every route, so the proxy cannot
> reach this server itself; at most 16 proxied requests run at once, of which internet clients may
> hold 12 (503 beyond, counted in `/stats.json` `proxyRefused`); the upstream has 30 s, name
> lookups aside, to connect and answer, redirects included, and to deliver a playlist (504
> beyond); and a playlist is read, decompressed and rewritten within fixed sizes.

## 4. Subtitles

| Method | Path | server.js | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/subtitles.:ext` | 46721 | convert/serve subtitles (e.g. .vtt) |
| GET | `/subtitlesTracks` | 46693 | list subtitle tracks |
| GET | `/opensubHash` | 46706 | **OpenSubtitles hash** — must match algorithm exactly |
| GET | `/tracks/:url` | 46644 | track extraction |
| GET | `/subtitleSignature` | *(absent)* | embedded-subtitle signature — **client-only, no reference** |

### `/subtitleSignature` — the one route the reference does not define

`stremio-video` 0.0.93 (2026-08-12, already the pin on `stremio-web@development`) calls
`GET /subtitleSignature?videoUrl=<url>[&container=<format.name>]` once per load whose probe does not
rule out an embedded subtitle track, and stores the answer on `videoParams.embeddedSubtitleSignature`.

Unlike every other row above, there is nothing to match against:

- `server.reference.js` (v4.21.1, 6.7 MB) — **0 occurrences**; the same is true of the copy published
  at `dl.strem.io` and of the one inside `tsaridas/stremio-docker:latest`, which answers **404**;
- nothing consumes the value — neither `stremio-core` nor `stremio-web` mentions it, and within
  `stremio-video` it is only ever produced.

We therefore serve the envelope with `signature: null`. That is the client's own documented "nothing
here" value and the branch it already takes when the request fails. We do **not** invent a string:
the client accepts any string, so a fabricated one would start being used the day a consumer ships
upstream, and wrong subtitle matching is far harder to trace than absent subtitle matching. Revisit
when a server release defines the algorithm — `subtitleSignatureAsks` in `/stats.json` counts the
demand in the meantime.

## 5. Built-in addon (manifest) — 91xxx

| Method | Path | server.js | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/manifest.json` | 91812 | addon manifest |
| GET | `/:resource/:type/:id/:extra?.json` | 91814 | addon resource (catalog/meta/stream) |

> Likely the server's bundled local addon. Confirm whether clients depend on it or only on
> external addons (Torrentio etc.). If only external → this is **out of scope** (parity not required).

## 6. Archive streaming (niche)

`.use("/rar" /zip /tar /tgz /7zip /ftp /nzb)` (46918–46928) — stream media out of archive/container
torrents. Low priority; many torrents aren't archived. Defer unless fixtures show client reliance.

## 7. YouTube / casting/convert (likely out of scope)

`/yt/:id` (46681), `/yt/:id.json` (46672), casting module `/:devID` (83821), `/convert:ext?`,
`/transcode:ext?` (83821). Not needed for torrent streaming to TVs; defer/skip.

---

## 8. Downloader IPC (v4.20.18+) — deliberately not implemented

Added upstream in **v4.20.18** (2026-05-05), still present in v4.21.1, and the *only* route change
between v4.20.16 and v4.21.1. It is not part of the client↔server protocol: the namespace is mounted
only when whatever spawned the server passes a secret in the environment —

```js
process.env.SERVER_IPC_KEY && enginefs.router.use(`/${process.env.SERVER_IPC_KEY}/downloader`, downloader)
```

— so with `SERVER_IPC_KEY` unset the routes do not exist at all, which is how `tsaridas/stremio-docker`
runs it. A browser client cannot reach them either: it has no way to learn the key.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/getAll` | every download record, as JSON |
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/get?id=` | one record |
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/add?url=` | start a download from a URL |
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/pause?id=` | pause a `running` download |
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/resume?id=` | resume a `paused`/`error` download |
| GET | `/{key}/downloader/remove?id=` | drop the record; unlinks the file when `finished` |

It is a **plain HTTP file downloader** (`node-downloader-helper`), not a torrent manager: records
carry `id`, `url`, `fileName`, `downloaded`, `total`, `progress` and `status`, state persists to
`downManager.json`, and files land in `<appPath>/downloads`. It is therefore not parity debt —
implementing it would only matter if we wanted a desktop shell's own Downloads pane to drive this
server rather than its bundled one.

## Parity priority (what to implement, in order)

1. **§1 file serving + stats + lazy create** (show-stopper; Stage 2).
2. **§3 settings/network-info/device-info/status/heartbeat** (handshake; Stage 1/2).
3. **§2 hlsv2 transcode + probe + hwaccel-profiler** (Stage 3).
4. **§3 `/proxy`** for non-torrent/debrid streams (Stage 3 — parity for direct/debrid addons).
5. **§4 subtitles + opensubHash** (Stage 4).
6. **§5 built-in addon, §6 archives, §7 yt/cast** — confirm need; likely skip.

## Response-body capture — done

The shapes this section once listed as outstanding (`/settings`, `/network-info`, `/device-info`,
`/:hash/:idx/stats.json`, `/hwaccel-profiler`, `/hlsv2/probe`, `master.m3u8` + `video0.m3u8`, and
the Range response headers of `/:hash/:idx`) were captured and are recorded below. They became the
conformance fixtures, which now live in the `stremio-loop` repo and gate every release.

What is genuinely still unmapped is narrower: the built-in addon / archive / cast families
(§5–§7), which are listed above as confirm-need-then-likely-skip rather than as work in progress.

---

## Captured shapes (Task 0.3 — first pass)

Fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`. **Confirmed:**

- `GET /settings` → `{"options":[…UI descriptors…], "values":{…}, "baseUrl":"http://<ip>:11470"}`.
  `values` keys include: `serverVersion, appPath, cacheRoot, cacheSize, btMaxConnections,
  btHandshakeTimeout, btRequestTimeout, btDownloadSpeedSoftLimit, btDownloadSpeedHardLimit,
  btMinPeersForStable, remoteHttps, localAddonEnabled, transcodeHorsepower, transcodeMaxBitRate,
  transcodeConcurrency, transcodeTrackConcurrency, transcodeHardwareAccel, transcodeProfile,
  allTranscodeProfiles, transcodeMaxWidth, proxyStreamsEnabled, btProfile`.
  **Our `/settings` must return all three keys (`options`/`values`/`baseUrl`), not a flat dict.**
- `GET /network-info` → `{"availableInterfaces":["<ip>", …]}`.
- `GET /device-info` → `{"availableHardwareAccelerations":["nvenc-linux","vaapi-renderD128", …]}`.
- `GET /stats.json` (idle) → `{}`.
- `GET /casting/` → `[]` (array).
- `GET /opensubHash?videoUrl=…` → `{"error":null,"result":{"size":<bytes>,"hash":"<16hex>"}}`.
- `GET /:hash/:idx` (Range) → `206 Partial Content` with `Accept-Ranges: bytes`,
  `Content-Range: bytes A-B/TOTAL`, `Content-Type: <per-file>`, plus DLNA headers
  (`transferMode.dlna.org: Streaming`, `contentFeatures.dlna.org: …`), `Connection: keep-alive`.

**Corrections to the route table:**
- `/status` is **404 at top level** (`Cannot GET /status`) — the line-75852 route lives in a
  sub-router, not the root. Do **not** implement top-level `/status`.

**CONFIRMED — `GET /:infoHash/stats.json` (active engine) schema** (Stage 2 contract; fixture must be
SANITIZED — placeholder infoHash/name, redacted peer IPs):
```jsonc

**CONFIRMED — `GET /hlsv2/:id/:track.m3u8` media playlist** (Stage 3 contract; fMP4/CMAF):
```m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:7
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:1
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-MAP:URI="video0/init.mp4?mediaURL=<urlenc>&profile=<prof>&maxWidth=<n>"
#EXTINF:0.200033,
video0/segment1.m4s?mediaURL=<urlenc>&profile=<prof>&maxWidth=<n>
```
Key facts for parity:
- **fMP4 segments** (`init.mp4` via `#EXT-X-MAP` + `segmentN.m4s`), HLS **v7**, `VOD`.
- Every init/segment URL **carries the query** (`mediaURL`, `profile` e.g. `vaapi-renderD128`,
  `maxWidth`) — the server keys the converter off these, so they must round-trip on sub-requests.
- Captured against the bundled `samples/hevc.mkv` (the hwaccel test clip → short, one segment);
  a real title produces many `#EXTINF`/segment lines + `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`. Content-neutral, no scrub.

**Still ⏳ (nice-to-have, not blocking):**
- `master.m3u8` + `audio0.m3u8` bodies (same family), a real `.m4s`/`init.mp4` (binary), `/hlsv2/probe`
  success body. Capture before Stage 3.
- `/hwaccel-profiler` success body (informational — our server controls HW detection).

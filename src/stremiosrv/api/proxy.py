"""GET/HEAD /proxy/<opts>/<path>: the stock server's proxy for addon HTTP streams.

stremio-video routes a stream through it whenever the addon sets `behaviorHints.proxyHeaders` -- the
request and response headers that stream needs -- and stremio-core builds the same URL for external
players. The server fetches `d` + path with those headers and relays the answer; an HLS playlist is
rewritten so its segments come back through the proxy too. There was no such route before 1.6.7:
nginx answered with the web player's index.html and those streams never played.

Limits the stock proxy does not have, because this server may face the internet and serves the web
player on the same origin: every answer is sandboxed, so a page fetched from anywhere cannot run on
that origin; a web page on another site is judged like an internet client; at most MAX_CONCURRENT
proxied requests run at once (each holds a worker thread while its upstream is slow, and enough of
them would stall every other route), of which internet clients may hold only MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTSIDE,
so the home network always finds a place; and a playlist is read, decompressed and rewritten within
fixed sizes (a small compressed body, or many short lines, could otherwise grow without bound).

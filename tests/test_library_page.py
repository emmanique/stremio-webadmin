# --- structural coverage: a script reaching for markup that is not there, or a loader nothing
# calls, are both silent failures with no error to catch -- the browser returns null, or the
# function simply never runs, and the feature quietly does not appear. A per-feature substring
# test cannot catch either shape, because it only ever inspects the one string it was written to
# check. This page shipped exactly that shape once already: a link whose loader was never wired to
# anything that would run it, so it never rendered, while a substring test on the loader's own body
# stayed green throughout. These three check the two failure modes -- and whether a same-origin
# call is even a real route -- structurally, over the whole page, so the next feature shipped this
# way is caught too, not just the addon panel that prompted writing them.

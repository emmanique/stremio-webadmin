"""The /library router: an authenticated download manager on the web player's own origin.

Mounted only when `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_UI` is set (see app.create_app), so with the flag off none of
these routes exist at all rather than existing and refusing.

Auth is the owner's Stremio account. The browser presents an authKey — read from the web player's
own localStorage on this same origin, or obtained through the sign-in form — and the server proves
it against api.strem.io, checks it against the pinned owner, and issues a session cookie. The
authKey is never stored server-side: stream resolution happens in the browser, so the server has no
use for one.

    Only pins are re-added to the libtorrent session at startup, so after any restart everything
    else -- which is most of the cache -- has no handle, and per-file facts came only from a
    handle. A season pack then collapsed back into one card carrying the PACK's name and the whole
    directory's size, which says nothing about which episode is actually there. Restarting is not
    an unusual state: changing any setting on the appliance restarts the container.

    The files are on the disk either way. `cache.data_bytes` is what makes this honest --
    libtorrent allocates the whole torrent sparsely, so `st_size` reports what a file WILL be while
    its holes say what has not arrived yet. Not the allocation: a compressing filesystem stores a
    finished file in less space than its length, and a complete episode read as 99.8%.

    `live` is the session's own list for this torrent when it holds the torrent without tracking
    it -- playback filling a title is the usual case (Engine.live_files). A file on that list may
    be being written right now, and its holes are the one thing the disk cannot be asked about
    cheaply or reliably while it is, so its byte count comes from the handle instead. Only that
    number changes source: the listing is still the disk's, with no index and nothing wanted.

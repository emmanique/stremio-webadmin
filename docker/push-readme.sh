# The overview is not part of the image, so pushing a tag never touches it -- it drifted two releases
# behind before this existed. Run it whenever the README changes; docker/publish.sh calls it too.

#
# The credential is sent only to hub.docker.com and never printed. It is kept out of argv as well (jq
# reads it from the environment; the session JWT goes to curl via a 0600 config file), so it does not
# show up in `ps` on a shared host.
#
# Env overrides: DOCKERHUB_USER, REPO, README, DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON.

    The alert pump must poll ``session.pop_alerts()`` (owned wrappers, stable lifetime) and must
    NEVER call ``session.wait_for_alert()``: even when its return value is discarded in Python, the
    boost.python binding still materialises it — dynamic_cast'ing the *borrowed* front-of-queue alert
    pointer, which can dangle under load and segfault. Runs the real loop against a fake session
    (no libtorrent session, no network)."""

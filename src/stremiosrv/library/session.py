"""Owner pinning and browser sessions for the library UI.

Two separable things live here, and conflating them is the failure this module exists to prevent:

* **The link** — which Stremio account owns this box. `getUser` succeeding proves only that an
  authKey belongs to *a* valid account; without pinning, anybody with any Stremio account gets in.
* **The door** — which browsers currently hold a session.

Only the account `_id` is persisted. An email can be changed on the account while the id cannot, and
storing the address would put the owner's email in a file for no benefit.

"""ffmpeg's guarded way to read an EXTERNAL media URL.

The transcode routes (/hlsv2, /{ih}/{idx}/subtitles.*) get a `mediaURL` from the client. When it is
our own torrent-stream URL -- /{ih}/{idx}, at our loopback address or the SERVER_URL host -- ffmpeg
may read it directly. Everything else must NOT be handed to ffmpeg directly, including our own
`/proxy/...` URL: ffmpeg 4.4.1 follows redirects itself, so a public URL that 302s into the LAN
would slip past a one-shot check, and a /proxy URL would have ffmpeg re-enter /proxy over loopback,
where the destination guard sees only the loopback caller and classifies it HOME -- an internet
client's own mediaURL escalating to a home-classified fetch (C1). Instead the URL -- or, for a
/proxy URL, its INNER destination, parsed out with the same opts.parse /proxy itself uses -- is
registered as a ticket and ffmpeg is handed a loopback reader URL (Task 6's route); the reader
fetches through the same destination guard /proxy uses, re-checking every redirect, with the
home-vs-internet decision taken from the ORIGINAL client request -- never from ffmpeg's own loopback
call.

"""The bundled web player must keep applying the server URL the entrypoint seeds.

loader.js (in the web build) sends `HEAD server_url.env` and applies localStorage.json's server URL
only when that answers 2xx; otherwise it ignores SERVER_URL and uses the page's own origin. Until
1.6.7 no such file existed and nginx answered the HEAD with the web player's index.html (200) --
the seed worked by accident. Once unknown paths 404, the file has to exist.

"""Transcode job-directory lifecycle: deletion on stop, orphan sweeping, and containment.

Before this, nothing in the package ever removed a job directory: `/destroy` terminated ffmpeg and
left the whole fMP4 segment tree on disk, and `"transcode"` is in cache.PROTECTED so the evictor was
forbidden from touching it. A single job dir on our own box survived two months and two container
restarts holding 173 files. At `-hls_time 4` a two-hour playback writes ~1800 segments, so the leak
is measured in thousands of files and gigabytes per week of ordinary viewing.
